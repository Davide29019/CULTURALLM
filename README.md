# CULTURALLM

## Description
CULTURALLM is an interactive platform where users can play by answering questions posed by other users. Both AI and users can respond to questions of any type. Once a question is closed, a ranking of the best answers is generated and published, and the top contributors receive rewards and prizes. The platform includes global leaderboards, daily and weekly missions, and allows users to either create their own questions or have them generated by an AI model.
